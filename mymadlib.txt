My dog Bill is the most <adjective> lil' guy on the planet.
He loves to eat <food> , especially after he learns a new
trick or how to <verb> . Part of me is sure he thinks I'm the most
boring <insult> on Earth, since I'm on my computer working,
studying, or <computer-activity> all day long, but then I see
his <body-part> wag when it's time to go for a/an <verb> and I
truly see that he looks at me like I'm <Non-Greek-or-Roman-Deity> .
I read that a dog's diet is supposed to be <number> % treats,
but it's definitely closer to 100% with such a <adjective> boy.
